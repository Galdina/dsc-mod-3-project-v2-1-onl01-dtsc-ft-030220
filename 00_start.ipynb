    "1. **Customer churn**, also known as customer attrition, occurs when customers stop doing business with a company or stop using a companyâ€™s services. By being aware of and monitoring churn rate, companies are equipped to determine their customer retention success rates and identify strategies for improvement. We can use a machine learning model to understand the precise customer behaviors and attributes which signal the risk and timing of customer churn.\n"

    "\n",
    "There are a couple major factors to consider before coming to any conclusions regarding the average charges. Firstly, it would make sense that the total amount charged to the customers who churned would be lower, as they may have stayed with the company considerably less time than the costumers who stayed with the company. In this case, we would have to investigate how long each customer has been with the company, a feature not in this dataset. Secondly, in regards to the monthly charges, it could be possible that long-time customers could have had a discount. It's also possible that long-term customers pay for less services. Let's investigate this possibility by using the previously created feature for the total amount of services a customer has."
